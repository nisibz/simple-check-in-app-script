# Google Sheets Check-In/Check-Out Web Form

This project demonstrates how to create a web form for check-in and check-out using Google Sheets as the database. The solution utilizes Google Apps Script along with HTML and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up the check-in/check-out web form:

### Step 1: Set Up Google Sheets

1. Create a new Google Sheets document.

### Step 2: Open Script Editor

1. Open the Script Editor by clicking on `Extensions` -> `Apps Script`.
2. Delete any existing code in the script editor.

### Step 3: Write Google Apps Script Code and HTML

Code in the script editor with the following:

- script.gs
- index.html

### Step 4: Deploy the Web App

1. Click on the deploy button (rocket icon) and deploy it as a web app.
   Set access to "Anyone, even anonymous" under the "Who has access to the app" section.

2. Click "Deploy" and authorize the necessary permissions.

### Step 5: Access the Web App

Once deployed, you'll receive a link to the web app. Open the link in a browser, and you should see the form for check-in and check-out.

Users can fill out the form, and the data will be recorded in the Google Sheets.

Note: This is a basic example, and you may need to add more features or validations based on your specific requirements.
